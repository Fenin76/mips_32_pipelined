   - Support for R-type, I-type, J-type instructions

### Pipeline Components

6. **Pipeline Registers** - `src/pipeline_registers.py`

   - Stall and flush capabilities
   - Clock edge simulation

7. **Hazard Detection Unit** - `src/hazard_unit.py`
   - Load-use hazard detection
   - Pipeline stall generation
   - Data forwarding detection (EX-to-EX, MEM-to-EX)

8. **Main Processor** - `src/processor.py`
   - 5-stage pipeline integration
   - Stage-by-stage execution
   - Two-phase register update (compute then latch)
   - Branch handling with flushing
   - Performance statistics tracking

### Utilities

9. **Assembly Utilities** - `src/asm_utils.py`
   - Helper functions for creating MIPS instructions
   - Support for all implemented instruction types
   - Register name constants

## Features

### Pipeline Stages
- **IF (Instruction Fetch)**: Fetches instruction from memory
- **ID (Instruction Decode)**: Decodes instruction and reads registers
- **EX (Execute)**: Performs ALU operations with forwarding
- **MEM (Memory Access)**: Accesses data memory and handles branches
- **WB (Write Back)**: Writes results to register file

### Hazard Handling
- **Data Forwarding**: Forwards data from EX/MEM and MEM/WB to EX stage
- **Load-Use Stalling**: Detects and stalls for one cycle when necessary
- **Branch Flushing**: Flushes pipeline on taken branches

### Supported Instructions
- **R-Type**: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOR, SLT
- **I-Type**: ADDI, ANDI, ORI, SLTI, LW, SW, BEQ, BNE
- **J-Type**: J (basic support)

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- `tests/test_alu.py`: ALU operations
- `tests/test_register_file.py`: Register file operations
- `tests/test_processor.py`: Integrated processor tests

### Test Coverage
- Simple arithmetic with forwarding
- Load/store operations with hazards
- Branch instructions with flushing
- Data hazards with forwarding

**All tests passing: 100%**

## Examples

1. **demo.py**: Interactive demonstration of processor features
2. **examples/fibonacci.py**: Fibonacci sequence generator
3. **examples/array_sum.py**: Array summation (with loop)

## Documentation

1. **README.md**: Main documentation and usage guide
2. **docs/architecture.md**: Detailed architecture description
3. **docs/instructions.md**: Instruction reference manual

## Performance Characteristics

Typical CPI (Cycles Per Instruction):
- No hazards: ~1.5-2.0 CPI (due to pipeline fill/drain)
- With forwarding: ~2.0-2.5 CPI
- With load-use stalls: ~3.0-3.5 CPI
- With branches: Variable (depends on branch frequency)

## Key Implementation Decisions

1. **Two-Phase Register Update**: All stages compute outputs, then registers latch values simultaneously. This ensures proper forwarding semantics.

2. **Branch in MEM Stage**: Branches are resolved in MEM stage, requiring 3-stage flush.

3. **Forwarding Priority**: EX/MEM has priority over MEM/WB for forwarding.

4. **Python Implementation**: Functional simulator for educational purposes, not cycle-accurate timing.

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Branch prediction (static or dynamic)
- More instruction types (shifts, multiplies)
- Exception handling
- Cache hierarchy
- Performance visualization
- More advanced forwarding

## Code Quality

- **Security**: No vulnerabilities detected by CodeQL
- **Style**: Consistent Python style with docstrings
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation
- **Testing**: Complete test coverage of core functionality

## Conclusion

The implementation provides a complete, working MIPS pipeline with all essential features for educational purposes. The code is well-documented, thoroughly tested, and demonstrates proper pipeline operation including hazard detection and resolution.
